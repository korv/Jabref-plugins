Renamefile plugin.

This plugin can be used to rename/copy/delete files attached
to the BibTex entries (stored in the field "file").

1. Name patterns

Files can be renamed according to their BibTeX entry.
The rename pattern uses the same syntax as the BibTeX
key generator of JabRef. For more details see
http://jabref.sourceforge.net/help/LabelPatterns.php

Additionally to the existing keys there is a key [type]
for an entry type.

Additionally to the existing modifiers (:lower, :upper, :abbr)
there is a modifier :regex:str1:str2 that replaces string str1
by string str2. One can apply several modifiers to one field.

Some examples of name patterns:
[bibtexkey]
folder/subfolder/[auth]. [shorttitle]
[type]/[auth]-[year]-[title]
[authors]. [title]
[auth]-[year]-[shorttitle]
[auth:lower]_[veryshorttitle:lower]_[year]
[auth]_[title:regex: :_] - replaces spaces by underscores
[authors:regex:':] - removes ' from all names


2. Folders

2.1. One can move files relative to their current position: 
Uncheck "Use folder".

2.2 One can move files relative to the file directory:
Check "Use folder" and specify the relative folder.
Example: folder/subfolder or folder\subfolder.

The file directory should be defined in
Options/Preferences/External programs/Main file directory
If it is empty, then the location of the bib file is used.

2.3 One can move files using absolute paths:
Check "Use folder" and specify the absolute folder.
Example c:\folder\subfolder.

3. Several files in one entry
If there are several files attached to one entry, then
numbers are added at the end of file names.
